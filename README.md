[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

# Endeavor
I always ache for this centralized thing or place to which I can turn. Almost like a wizards wand or JARVIS for Iron Man or Joseph Smiths seer stone. I think increasingly smart phones have become that thing for everyone. I want to build an ecosystem of applications that help structure my life.

This application is supposed to be kinda the center of that. This is where I will manage my time and therefore my life.

The core concept is that of an Endeavor. This was born out of the idea that we don't do each individual task for it's own sake. We're always working toward something bigger. The endeavor is a way to put a name to that thing your working toward. In fact, every moment of every day, sleeping or waking, you could think of yourself as engaged in some endeavor. Sleeping, you're working toward your health, working, you're building a career or supporting yourself and loved ones, watching T.V. you're relaxing or learning. Great philosophers of the past all grappled with time management and now that we most need that philosophy, we've relagated time management to just a chore.

When asking myself what I needed to do, I used to go through the major things in my life. Church, School, Work and I'd covered everything for all of those, I felt sure that I wasn't leaving out something important and that nagging voice in the back of my head went away.


## Ecosystem
Eventually, this app will contain much of the central data for other important applications. For example, this app will contain the info for exactly how much time you plan to spend working for the next month. That data, combined with your hourly rate contains the income half of your budget. These two apps will need to be deeply linked.

I believe this means that I will need to use a router?


## 15 minutes
I always envision this plan of building it little bits at a time so that over the course of the next two years it comes together. But I only ever put 15 minutes toward it and then start fresh again.



This could be a **documentation problem**.



Forgetting whatâ€™s going on with the project is huge. Something that takes 5 minutes to read that gets me back up to date on the project could allow me to spend the other 10 on the project itself.



So now this README.md is the central documentation for me to review what's going on in the project and get myself back up to speed.


## Server
If I could have a centralized server where the data models run, I could make all sorts of client side apps that access the central data. 

## Tools
I'm using Flutter version _______, dart version _______, and firebase for the backend.

## Notes for later
* In section number 4 [here](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/firestore/overview), there is a tip for reducing building time on iOS and macOS, I should keep that in mind when I'm building on those regularly

### What kind of tool do I want?
* I kinda like the idea of a progressive tool. One that can be used for the simplest use case. In this case just a to-do list and you can add in whatever fancy features you want for the given task.
* The opposing point of view is making a super powerful tool that you have to LEARN learn like the Adobe applications.
* Maybe instead of flows like turbotax, I could use the photoshop model of a giant array of tools


## Task Brainstorming
* Endeavor Blocks
* Tasks with duration
* Assign tasks to endeavors
* Auto Plan

* An endeavor brain to enforce continuity of planning
    * I could make building this planning thing my first use case.

* In physics there's this concept of de-dimensionalizing. Or rather, usefulizing units. You could understand your time in units of time/rent-payment by dividing time up into units of amount of time you have to work to pay for rent. Then a useless number, like an "8-hour" shift becomes a useful number. Like if rent is $700 and you make $13/hour, then 54 hours is one rent payment. So your shift is about 1/7th of a rent payment. Or if a meal is $20, then an 8-hour shift is a 5-meal shift which is an "eat for almost two days" shift. You could even average how much you spend per day from your budget and measure how much you make compared to that. You could make a unit that is (% of monthly expenses), like if you spend $1200/month, your % unit would be $12. Then an 8 hour shift would be about an 8% shift.

* the concept of a repeating endeavor block as an endeavor block generator is interesting. Just thinking of generators is interesting. What generates endeavors? What generates tasks? a generator could be an API that I reach out to to get new tasks like Canvas or something

## UI Notes
* NAVIGATION BAR: So I'm thinkin that the bottom selector might be a [NavigationBar](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/NavigationBar-class.html) bar that goes into the [Scaffold's](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Scaffold-class.html) bottomNavigationBar property

## Calendar View Notes
* I found [this](https://github.com/Skyost/FlutterWeekView/blob/master/lib/src/widgets/week_view.dart) package out there, and I think I could either use and fork it or learn from it to make my own from scratch. I'm tempted to make it from scratch because I would need so much freedom with it. 

### Use then Fork
* I could set my blocks as just events at first then just schedule things next to them.
* Then eventually I could figure out how to color the background.

### From Scratch
* So it looks like he does a horizontal Listview where each takes up a whole screen and custom physics to snap to the nearest day. I'd like to fit 3 days on the screen like google calendars. 
* Then each List item must be a scroll view where you can see the whole day.


## What I'm working on now
* You can create an endeavor block and delete it, but I'm thinking it needs some major rework to even be workable
    * When you create one you should be taken to the only or first instance.
    * when you delete an endeavor, all of it's endeavor blocks should be deleted

* I think repeating endeavor blocks is a must
    * This requires
        * Start Date
        * End Date
        * selected days
        * Start Time
        * End Time
        * When I integrate a brain I'd like to have one for the repeating event and for the single event
    * Then How am I going to store it?
        * It would be nice to have individual storage for each event
        * I could have a repeating endeavor blocks collection in the endeavorBlocks collection where each repeating endeavor block has it's own collection of endeavor blocks
        * I could have a repeating endeavorBlocks section where each just holds a list of references to blocks in the endeavor blocks collection and each block that belongs to a repeating could store a bool that says so

* steps to take
    * Do I need to restructure existing classes?
        * I could merge EndeavorBlock and one_time_endeavor_block to just EndeavorBlock
        * Then I could create a RepeatingEndeavorBlock that uses a repeating event to create a list of endeavor blocks each of which would have a reference to the RepeatingEndeavorBlock
    * Do I need to pull out the code where an endeavor block is produced so that the create_endeavor_block screen can just call that however many times it needs?
    * Should I just make a repeating event because I will need to do that for tasks anyway?

* Plan
    * Make the UI
        * I will need to create the form element for a RepeatingEventPicker
            * I'm immaining that it could just be 4 lines. Start date, and a button that shows the date or "select date", same for end date, and start and end times exactly the same as the single event picker
                * start date could default to either today or the selected date
                * I'm immagining the date ones just pop up a date picker
                * This means I could make a start and end time picker that I use in both
        * I will need to button to have two submit functions
            * I have the single endeavor block one done
            * I will need the other to create the RepeatingEndeavorBlock on the server, then all of it's EndeavorBlocks in the server



* Big Steps
    * Deleting endeavor deletes all of it's endeavor blocks
    * Make it so you can add tasks with an estimated time, due date, and endeavor assignment
    * Auto planning algorithm
